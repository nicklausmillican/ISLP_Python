        "Describe the null hypotheses to which the p-values given in **Table 3.4** correspond. Explain what conclusions you can draw based on these p-values. Your explanation should be phrased in terms of $sales$, $TV$, $radio$, and $newspaper$, rather than in terms of the coefcients of the linear model.\n",

        "\n",
        "| Term       | Coefficient | Std. error | t-statistic | p-value  |\n",
        "|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|----------|\n",
        "| Intercept  | 2.939       | 0.3119     | 9.42        | < 0.0001 |\n",
        "| TV         | 0.046       | 0.0014     | 32.81       | < 0.0001 |\n",

        "\n",
        "Now for the null-hypotheses.  The first thing to recognize is that the values from this table are taken from multiple regression.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Next, it's helpful to get a sense of null-hypothesis signifcance testing.  The basic idea is that we detail what we think a probability distribution of our outcome variable would look like if it was not realted to the explanatory variable(s) in question.  We can call this a *null* distribution; the \"null hypothesis\" is the hypothesis that the null distribution accurately describes the data.  If it does, we retain the null hypothesis; if it does not, we reject it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, a generic phrasing for each p-value is something like:\n",
        ">\"After accounting for _____, _____, and _____, there is no association between $sales$ and _____.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let's consider $TV$:\n",

        "\n",
        "As for the conclusions based on p-values, these can also follow a generic script:\n",
        ">\"After accounting for _____, _____, and _____, the null hypothesis that the association between $sales$ and _____ being due to chance is _____% probable.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "So again for $TV$:\n",
        ">\"After accounting for $radio$, $newspaper$, and the $Intercept$, the null hypothesis that the association between $sales$ and $TV$ being due to chance is < 0.0001% probable.\""
